        <h3>Mac Miller's Life</h3>
        <p class="bio">
            <strong>Malcolm James McCormick</strong> (January 19, 1992 – September 7, 2018), known professionally as
            <strong>Mac Miller</strong>, was an American rapper, singer, songwriter, and record producer from
            Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Miller began his career in Pittsburgh's hip hop scene in 2007, at the age of
            fifteen. In 2010, he signed a record deal with independent label Rostrum Records and released his
            breakthrough mixtapes K.I.D.S. (2010) and Best Day Ever (2011). Miller's debut studio album, Blue Slide Park
            (2011), became the first independently distributed debut album to top the US Billboard 200 since 1995.
            In 2013, he founded the record label imprint REMember Music. After his second studio album, Watching Movies
            with the Sound Off (2013), he left Rostrum and signed with the major label Warner Bros. Records in 2014.
            With them, he released four studio albums: GO:OD AM (2015), The Divine Feminine (2016), Swimming (2018), and
            the posthumous Circles (2020). For Swimming, he was posthumously nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Rap
            Album. He also served as a record producer for various artists, including himself, under the pseudonym Larry
            Fisherman.
            <br>
            Miller struggled with substance abuse, which was often referenced in his lyrics.[1] On September 7, 2018,
            Miller died from an accidental drug overdose of cocaine, fentanyl, and alcohol at his home, aged 26.
